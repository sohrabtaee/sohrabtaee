I've been also involved in recruiting and mentoring developers.

My technical workflow consists of using Git, writing well-tested maintainable code, and conducting code reviews.\

I do my best to have a balance in every aspect of my job and personal life.\
I'm a constant learner and I value personal development.\
I enjoy working in non-hierarchical, transparent, and trust-based environments.\
